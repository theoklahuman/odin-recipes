This is one of the first projects that tested my knowledge of the simple concepts of html and CSS. It's a simple project to test the basics and I've really enjoyed playing with the html and css so far. 

Disclaimer: The ingredients and steps won't get you to the finished product in the images. The focus is on the html and css, not the food. :)
